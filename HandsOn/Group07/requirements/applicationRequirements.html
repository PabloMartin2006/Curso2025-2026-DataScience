  <h1>Application Requirements</h1>
  <h2>Application: Madrid Air Quality Dashboard</h2>

  <p>
    This document shows the main requirements and initial design draft of the application that will be developed based on the
    <strong>Air Quality in Madrid (2024)</strong> dataset.
    The goal of the application is to provide an accessible and visual way to explore air quality data across Madrid,
    helping users understand pollution trends and identify the areas most affected by poor air quality.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Application Overview</h2>
  <p>
    The <strong>Madrid Air Quality Dashboard</strong> will be a web-based application that displays real-time and historical air quality
    measurements collected from stations that monitor air quality around the city.
    The system will allow users to visualize pollution data through maps, charts, and filters by pollutant, date, and location.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Functional Requirements</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>FR1.</strong> Display air quality data by pollutant type (e.g., NO₂, PM₁₀, O₃, SO₂, CO).</li>
    <li><strong>FR2.</strong> Filter data by station, date range, and pollutant.</li>
    <li><strong>FR3.</strong> Provide an interactive city map showing the stations with color-coded pollution levels.</li>
    <li><strong>FR4.</strong> Allow users to visualize historical trends using charts and graphs.</li>
    <li><strong>FR5.</strong> Offer short explanations of each pollutant and its health effects if exposed for a long time.</li>
    <li><strong>FR6.</strong> Export selected data as CSV or JSON for further analysis.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Non-Functional Requirements</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>NFR1.</strong> The interface should be available on both desktop and mobile devices.</li>
    <li><strong>NFR2.</strong> Data visualizations must update dynamically and load within seconds.</li>
    <li><strong>NFR3.</strong> The system should be designed for easy integration with Linked Data sources (RDF).</li>
    <li><strong>NFR4.</strong> The design should follow accessibility standards, to ensure understanding for all users.</li>
    <li><strong>NFR5.</strong> All data used in the application must satisfy open data requirements.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. User Interface Mock-ups</h2>

  <div class="mockup">
    <strong>Main Dashboard:</strong><br>
    - A top navigation bar with filters for pollutant, date range, and station.<br>
    - A map of Madrid in the center, with colored circles indicating air quality levels per station.<br>
    - Being over a station will display current pollutant values and the air quality index.<br>
  </div>

  <div class="mockup">
    <strong>Trends & Analysis View:</strong><br>
    - Line chart showing pollutant concentration changes over time.<br>
    - Bar graph comparing pollutants on a selected date.<br>
    - “Download data” button below the graphs.<br>
  </div>

  <div class="mockup">
    <strong>Information Panel:</strong><br>
    - Short explanations of each pollutant (e.g., “NO₂ – produced mainly by traffic emissions”).<br>
    - Simple recommendations, such as “Avoid outdoor exercise when PM₁₀ levels are high.”<br>
  </div>

  <h2>5. Expected Impact</h2>
  <p>
    The application objective is to raise awareness about air quality conditions in Madrid and help both
    citizens and local authorities make better decisions. By visualizing pollution data in an intuitive way, it will make environmental
    information more transparent and accessible to the public.

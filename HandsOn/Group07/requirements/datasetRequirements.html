  <h1>Dataset Requirements Evaluation</h1>
  <h2>Dataset: Air Quality in Madrid (Daily Data – 2024)</h2>

  <p>
    This document reviews whether the selected dataset — <strong>“Calidad del aire. Datos diarios desde 2001 (2024)”</strong> —
    meets the requirements stated at the first part of this Hands-On assignment.
    The dataset was obtained from the <a href="https://datos.madrid.es/">Madrid City Council Open Data Portal</a> and
    is available as a <strong>CSV</strong> file which contains daily air quality measurements collected across Madrid’s monitoring stations
    and it is regularly updated every month or so.
  </p>

  <p>
    The evaluation considers six requirements in total: four mandatory (R1–R4) and two optional (R5–R6).
    Each one is discussed below, indicating whether it is satisfied, partially satisfied, or not satisfied.
  </p>

  <h2>Requirements Analysis</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>R1. Belonging to a Smart City domain:</strong><br>
      The dataset fits within the <strong>Environmental and Public Health</strong> domain,
      which is an essential component of Smart Cities.
      It includes indicators such as NO₂, PM₁₀, O₃, SO₂, and CO, all of which reflect Madrid’s environmental conditions.  
      <span class="ok">✔ Satisfied</span>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>R2. Data available in CSV format:</strong><br>
      The dataset comes as a straightforward <strong>CSV</strong> file, no extra formatting or weird encodings, which made it easy to open and inspect.  
      We used the file named <em>air_quality_madrid_2024.csv</em> stored in the <code>csv/</code> directory.  
      This makes it ready for later conversion into RDF without much preprocessing.  
      <span class="ok">✔ Satisfied</span>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>R3. Open license:</strong><br>
      The dataset uses <strong>Madrid City Council’s Open Data License</strong>, which basically means
      anyone can reuse it as long as they give credit. This is perfect for this project as we can combine it with
      other sources without worrying.
      <span class="ok">✔ Satisfied</span>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>R4. Linkability with real-world entities:</strong><br>
      Each record includes station identifiers (<code>ESTACION</code> and <code>PUNTO_MUESTREO</code>)
      that can be linked to actual locations using coordinates from complementary datasets such as
      <em>Calidad del aire – Estaciones</em>.
      This makes it possible to connect the data with external sources like Wikidata or OpenStreetMap.  
      <span class="ok">✔ Satisfied</span>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>R5. Dataset documentation (optional):</strong><br>
      The official documentation — <em>“Interpreter of hourly, daily, and real-time air quality data files”</em> —
      provides an explanation of the columns, pollutant codes (<code>MAGNITUD</code>), units of measurement, and validation flags.
      This made it easier to understand the data and its context.  
      <span class="ok">✔ Satisfied</span>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>R6. Data from multiple sources (optional):</strong><br>
      The dataset currently originates from a single municipal source.
      However, it could be updated in the future by combining it with meteorological or traffic datasets to provide more context.  
      <span class="partial">⚪ Partially satisfied</span>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  
  <p>
    Overall, the <strong>Air Quality in Madrid (2024)</strong> dataset fulfills all four mandatory requirements (R1–R4)
    and meets some of the optional ones (R5–R6).
    It is therefore a good candidate for <strong>Linked Data transformation and integration</strong>,
    mainly for projects focused on <strong>urban sustainability and environmental monitoring</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    In future work, it would be better to incorporate additional data sources. For instance, weather or traffic data in order to better
    understand the factors that influence air quality in Madrid.
